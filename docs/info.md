## How it works

You input the 4 digit binary number using pins 0 - 3 with input pin 0 being LSB and input pin 3 MSB.
This way you can show any number between 0 and 9 (max binary is 1010 = 9)

## How to test

Enter any number you want and it will be displayed on the 7 segment display

## External hardware

One single digit 7 segment display.
